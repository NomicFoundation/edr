# Rethnet

**Rethnet** is an Ethereum development runtime library - written in Rust - with bindings for the Node API (TypeScript).
Its goal is to provide a performant API for developer tooling, such as an EVM debugger or state inspector.

Rethnet finds its origins in Hardhat but will be a complete rewrite of our Hardhat Network TypeScript code to Rust, incorporating all of the lessons we have learned over the years, and much more to come.
Currently, it exists within an experimental branch of the [Hardhat monorepo](https://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat/tree/rethnet/main/), where we have started to incrementally embed Rethnet's runtime components into Hardhat.
