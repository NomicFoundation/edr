# EIP-7892 BPO hardforks

- we want EDR to have bpo schedules configured by chain_id
    - each chain may have different schedules
- at the moment OP stack chains do not support blobs

- chain_id configurations are injected when creating a new ForkedBlockchain. 
- LocalBlockchain could be modified to receive the chain configs as parameter instead of receiving the base_fee_params and now the ScheduleBlobParams separatedly
