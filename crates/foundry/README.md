# Foundry Forge Fork

This a fork of [Foundry's](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry) [Forge](https://book.getfoundry.sh/forge/) as a library to serve as a basis of the Solidity tests features of EDR. The forked commit is: [0a5b22f07](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/commits/0a5b22f07)

Forge depends on a lot of crates within Foundry. These are included in this fork. The test suites for all these crates are included as well. Foundry Solidity build tools are necessary to run these tests, so these are also included.
