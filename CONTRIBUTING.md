## Note about small PRs and airdrop farming

We generally really appreciate external contributions, and strongly encourage meaningful additions and fixes! However, due to a recent increase in small PRs potentially created to farm airdrops, we might need to close a PR without explanation if any of the following apply:

- It is a change of very minor value that still requires additional review time/fixes (e.g. PRs fixing trivial spelling errors that canâ€™t be merged in less than a couple of minutes due to incorrect suggestions)
- It introduces inconsequential changes (e.g. rewording phrases)
- The author of the PR does not respond in a timely manner
- We suspect the Github account of the author was created for airdrop farming
